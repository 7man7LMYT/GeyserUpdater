# GeyserUpdater
This is a spigot/bungee plugin that will automatically update GeyserMC on a bungeecord or spigot network.
Note: The code for this plugin WAS NOT MADE BY ME! AlysaaKobe/Jens made the code, I just combined his two plugins. He gave me full permission to do this, and he gets 100% of the credit for this project.
Note: This is NOT ann official GeyserMC plugin. It is made to work with GeyserMC but it is not maintained or produced by GeyserMC. If you need support with this plugin, do not ask Geyser devs.
