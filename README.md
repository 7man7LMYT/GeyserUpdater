# GeyserUpdater


> GeyserUpdater is a plugin that can update Geyser-Spigot | Geyser-BungeeCord manually or automatic. 

## Downloading

You can download the plugin here |> https://ci.alysaa.net/job/GeyserUpdaterMain/job/main/ <|
or use the actions button in the GitHub bar and download the zip with the GeyserUpdater jar inside.

## Installation

GeyserUpdater can be installed on Spigot & Bungeecord. Place the GeyserUpdater plugin file in the plugins folder and restart the server.


Permissions:
```
gupdater.geyserupdate
```

Commands:

```
/geyserupdate 
```

Auto-Updating:

You can set Auto-Updating on true in the config.yml.
```

## Usage

After you ran the command or enabled auto updating, it will check the current running Geyser version. If it's outdated it will automatic download the latest Geyser build!
